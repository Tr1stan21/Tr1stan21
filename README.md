### üß† About Me

I'm currently studying **Cross-platform Application Development (DAM)**, passionate about building **efficient backend systems** and **clean, scalable architectures**.  
I enjoy solving problems through code, learning new technologies, and constantly improving my skills in **Java, Spring Boot, and Flutter**.  

My goal is to become a **backend developer** who writes maintainable, reliable, and well-structured software.  
Outside coding, I like exploring how **AI can optimize development workflows** and experimenting with new tools to automate tasks.
